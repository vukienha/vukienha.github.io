I built the app as a free app. 

This page is used to inform website visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and
    disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
    relation with this policy. The Personal Information that I collect are used for providing and
    improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described
    in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions,
    which is accessible at my App, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Which Google user data that application accesses, uses, stores, or shares ?**     
For the app working, I may require you to provide us with certain
    baisc personally information, such as users name, email. 
	The information that I request will be retained by us and used as described in this privacy policy.

**Security**    
I value your trust in providing us your basic Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
    the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
    guarantee its absolute security.


**Changes to This Privacy Policy**    
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
    periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
    on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
